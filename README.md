# Toddler Typing
This game is meant to help teach my toddler how a keyboard works and help improve letter, number, and direction recognition by both visual and audible reinforcement of the key pressed. I am in no way a professional on education at all, this was just something stupid to make to entertain them.

## Exit Game
Hold `Ctrl` and double press the `Delete` key.
